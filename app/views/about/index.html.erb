  <h2>Goals</h2>

  <p>Love Fern was germinated to satisfy the requirements for a Turing Backend Mod 3
  group project, Consultancy. Official project requirements can be read 
  <a href='https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/consultancy/'>here</a>.<p>


  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Implement OAuth2 with OmniAuth to allow users to sign in with Google.</li>
    <li>Use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via Bootstrap to design a pleasing front-end aesthetic.</li>
    <li>Building a full-scale application from scratch using service-oriented architecture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Future Goals</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Implement "watering frequency," which indicates how often a user wishes to interact with their fern before it starts to decay.</li>
    <li>Add more detailed stats to the fern show page, including time since last contact and information about the nature of that contact.</li>
    <li>Add the ability to search for a fern by name and order ferns by health.</li>
    <li>Suggest multiple activities and gestures corresponding to varying levels of care needed for the fern.</li>
    <li>Build out the fern health algorithm to incorporate activities and gifts, as well as a more nuanced interpretation of Google's sentiment analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known Issues</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>In its current state, Love Fern's backend API is not private. Future goals are to require a private token that only the Love Fern frontend will have. Until then, please do not provide any information you deem sensitive.</li>
    <li>The fertilize feature currently suggests a random activity to do with your fern's person. Please consider real life consequences are not our responsibility if you do ask your fern's person to do this activity.</li>
  </ul>
